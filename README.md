# Mocha â˜•
Mocha is a sleek, easy to use and (somewhat) customisable online video downloader which supports thousands of sites.

## Installation
### Building from source
To build from source you can use these simple commands, you will need [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

``git clone https://github.com/YoxieGraphics/mocha.git``

``cd mocha``

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

``pyinstaller mocha.spec"`` (This may take a few minutes)

Now navigate to the 'dist' directory and the mocha binary will be there
